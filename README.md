Customer Segmentation Analysis
Objective: The goal of this customer segmentation analysis is to categorize e-commerce customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behaviors and demographic data. This segmentation will help the business tailor its marketing strategies, improve customer targeting, and ultimately increase customer retention and sales.

Key Features:

Annual Income (k$): Represents the customer’s income level, which can be a key indicator of purchasing power.

Spending Score (1-100): Reflects the customer’s spending behavior, calculated based on their purchase history, frequency, and transaction size.

Cluster (Segment): The outcome of the clustering process, grouping customers with similar behaviors and characteristics.

Approach:

Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

The initial data is cleaned and processed to handle any missing values, outliers, or anomalies.

The columns of interest, such as annual income and spending score, are examined for consistency and transformed if necessary.

Clustering Analysis:

A clustering algorithm (like K-Means or Hierarchical clustering) is applied to group customers based on their income and spending score.

The optimal number of clusters is determined using techniques like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score.

Cluster Profiling:

Each cluster is analyzed to understand the characteristics of the customers within it, such as average income, spending patterns, and demographic trends.

This analysis helps identify key customer segments like "High-Income Big Spenders," "Moderate Income Moderate Spenders," or "Low-Income Savers."

Visualization:

A scatter plot is used to visualize the clusters, with Annual Income on the x-axis and Spending Score on the y-axis.

Different clusters are represented by distinct colors to highlight the customer segments visually.

Insights and Applications:

Each customer segment provides insights into how businesses can personalize their marketing strategies.

For example, customers in a high-income, high-spending cluster may be targeted with premium products and exclusive offers, while low-income, low-spending segments could benefit from value-based promotions or loyalty rewards.

Outcome: The analysis results in a clearer understanding of the customer base, leading to more effective, data-driven marketing campaigns, better customer experience personalization, and improved business strategies tailored to the needs of each customer group.
